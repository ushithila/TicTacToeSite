<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Rules and Download </h1>
   <p style="text-align:center;"> Like any game you heard of, Tic Tac Toe has its own set of rules! </p>
   <p style="text-align:center;"> The aim of the game is for you to be the first to get three in a row. This could be in either horizonital,
									vertical, or diagonal. Your opponent (the other player) would have to block you from getting three in a row and try to get  
									three in a row before you!</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;"> With that said, download our recreation (in the zip file) and have fun!</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;"> Enjoy!!!! </p>
